<p>
    Switch statements are a way of making your conditions more concise.
</p>
<p>
    Switch statements begin with the <span class="keyword">switch</span> keyword.
    Within the switch block, specific values are met which are denoted by the
    <span class="keyword">case</span> keyword. When a case is matched, it
    executes the lines from there until the next case.
</p>
<p>
    In addition to the <span class="keyword">case</span> keyword, there is the
    <span class="keyword">default</span> keyword. This is for when none of
    the cases match.
</p>
<p>
    The last keyword is <span class="keyword">fallthrough</span>.
    If we reach this keyword, the next case will match regardless of if it
    originally would of. The only except is if the next case is a
    <span class="keyword">default</span>. This is amazing for removing
    duplicate code.
</p>
<p>
    There are two other small little notes about switches.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>If a value is not passed in, cases can be conditions.</li>
    <li>Like <a href="if.html">if statements</a> switches can have scoped variables.</li>
</ul>
