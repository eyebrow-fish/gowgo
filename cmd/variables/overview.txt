    Like most modern languages Golang has a <span class="keyword">var</span>
    keyword. When using this keyword, a type must be provided after
    the name of the variable.
</p>
<p>
    However, the convention is to use the
    <span class="keyword">walrus operator</span>
    <span class="comment">(:=)</span>, unless the
    variable is outside of a function or not initialized yet.
</p>
<p>
    Additionally, there is the <span class="keyword">const</span>
    keyword. Normally, we only use this for variables outside of functions
    and when we know the value should stay the same.
</p>
<p>
    It's also important to note that your program won't compile if
    you have unused variables.
