<p>If statements are a crucial part to any program.</p>
<p>
    If statements start with the <span class="keyword">if</span> keyword.
    Directly after is the condition to be evaluated.
    Then the block to executed if the condition is <span class="prim">true</span>.
</p>
<p>
    Sometimes our conditions may be <span class="prim">false</span> and we want to
    do something else in this case. We do this with
    <span class="keyword">else</span> or <span class="keyword">else if</span>.
    The difference being that <span class="keyword">else</span> can only occur
    once and has no condition.
</p>
<p>
    Scoping variables are also an important feature.
    These are variables which are only accessible in the if conditions
    and blocks.
