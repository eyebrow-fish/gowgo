<p>Functions are blocks of code which optionally take parameters and optionally return value(s).</p>
<p>
    The syntax for functions always begin with <span class="keyword">func</span>.
    This is then followed by a name <span class="comment">(unless it's anonymous or assigned
    to a variable)</span>, the parameters
    <span class="comment">(wrapped in parenthesis)</span>,
    return values <span class="comment">(parenthesis if more than one)</span>, and body block.
</p>
<p>
    In function blocks there are two new keywords, <span class="keyword">return</span> and
    <span class="keyword">defer</span>. The <span class="keyword">return</span> keyword, forces the
    block to not proceed further and return the value to the right. Whereas, the
    <span class="keyword">defer</span> keyword is an expression which is executed after the function
    returns. Defers will still execute even if the program panics.
</p>
<p>
    Functions are in all modern languages, and are crucial to everyday development.
    They help separate code, deduplicate logic, move complexities, and more!
